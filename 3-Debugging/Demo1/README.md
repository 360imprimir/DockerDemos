# Creating app demo
Create a new ASP.Net Core MVC project and don't forget to select the **Enable Docker Support** checkbox.

To add container orchestrator support (docker compose):
* Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add** > **Container Orchestrator Support**.
* Choose the container orchestrator, in this case, **Docker Compose**
* Choose the **Target OS**

A docker-compose project is added to the solution.
